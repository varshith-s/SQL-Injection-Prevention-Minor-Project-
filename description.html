        Data Leaks have become common in this pandemic era and their
        consequences are hazardous to innocent users. This is because they may
        occur in known and unknown manner since it has many types which could
        cause these leaks.<br><br>
        As we see in our day-to-day life where people lose their sensitive data and
        then getting hacked, which ultimately results in a huge loss for them.
        Our Motive for the project designation is to prevent SQL Injection and to
        avoid such types of consequences.
        <hr>
        A SQL injection is a technique that attackers use to gain unauthorized access to a web application database by
        adding a string of malicious code to a database query. A SQL injection (SQLi) manipulates SQL code to provide
        access to protected resources, such as sensitive data, or execute malicious SQL statements.<br>
        SQLI uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access
        information that was not intended to be displayed.<br>

        <br>
        Testing is done for various SQL Injection techniques like:-<br>
        <strong style="color:red;">‘ or 1=1-- <br> ‘1’='1' or 'admin' etc..</strong>
        <br>
        The 1<sup>st</sup> query will change all the SQL statement always true because of the or keyword.
        And the rest of the SQL statement after '--' will be commmented.
        <br>
        The 2<sup>nd</sup> query will change all the SQL statement will also always be true.
        Because of the or keyword, and the two expression producting true values.
        <br>
        Therefore,for all types of Injection techniques the website refuses to login and is completely secured against
        any malicious attacks.
